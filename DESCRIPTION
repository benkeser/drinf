Description: This package uses targeted minimum loss-based estimation to
    construct estimators of a time-dependent covariate-adjusted mean that are
    doubly-robust with resepect to consistency and also with respect to asymptotic
    linearity. The latter property allows for the construction of doubly-robust
    confidence intervals
